# Arrays And Strings In C ++

## Title: Basic operations of Strings And Arrays in C ++
---
## Aim :
*To use basic functions and take input and output in C++*

## Introduction
This file gives a simple explanation of arrays and strings â€” two important concepts in programming. 

## Arrays

###  What is an Array?
An array is a way to store multiple values of the same type in one variable. Instead of using separate variables, arrays let us group related values.  
In C++, arrays have a fixed size and use index numbers (starting from 0) to access each element.

### Features
- Stored in continuous memory locations  
- Access any element using its index  
- Can store primitive or user-defined types

### Types of Arrays
- **1D Array**: A single row of values  
- **2D or Multi-dimensional Arrays**: Arrays of arrays (like a table)

### Common Operations
- Accessing elements: `arr[index]`  
- Inserting/deleting (can be slow due to shifting)  
- Traversing elements using loops  
- Searching and sorting

### Applications
- Grouping related data  
- Used in structures like stacks, queues, lists, etc.

## Strings
### What is a String?
A string is a sequence of characters. In C++, strings can be stored as character arrays or string objects.

### Features
 - May be immutable (unchangeable) or mutable depending on the language
 - Stored as arrays of characters internally
 - In C++, they can be modified using loops and functions

### Common String Operations
 - Concatenation (joining strings)
 - Getting substrings
 - Searching and comparing
 - Calculating length

`Enter the string:
racecar
racecar is a palindrome.`

## Conclusion
---
In this experiment, we explored the basics of arrays and strings in C++. Arrays allow us to store and work with collections of data using loops and indices. We performed operations like reversing, summing, and searching. Strings help handle text data and support operations such as joining, reversing, and checking for palindromes.
These concepts build the foundation for more advanced data structures and problem-solving in programming.
